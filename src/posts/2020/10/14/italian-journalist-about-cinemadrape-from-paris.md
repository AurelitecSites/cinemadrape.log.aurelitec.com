Journalist Mauro Donzelli writes about CinemaDrape on his blog:

> "A useful service if we think about how much time we waste on the computer just because we are distracted by any advertising banners or other sources that are currently useless."
>
> "Very useful for those who do not want to waste precious time due to increasingly tempting distractions."
>
> â€” _[translated from Italian]_
